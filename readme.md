# lab

Welcome to **lab** — my personal development and experimentation space. This repository is where I try out new ideas, test technologies, learn new skills, and prototype small projects before turning them into something bigger.

## 🧪 Purpose

The **lab** exists as a sandbox for creativity and growth. Here, I:
- Experiment with new frameworks, languages, and tools.
- Test out coding techniques and patterns.
- Explore APIs, data structures, and algorithms.
- Build proof-of-concept features or mini-projects.
